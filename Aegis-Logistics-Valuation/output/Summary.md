# Investment Note: Aegis Logistics

**Date:** Feb 20, 2026
**Subject:** Valuation Update - Price Disconnect?

Ran the numbers on Aegis. Bottom line: the stock feels very expensive at ₹775. 

My base case DCF comes in at **₹215/share**, which is a massive discount to where it's trading. Even if I give them the benefit of the doubt on the Vopak JV ramping up faster than expected, it's hard to justify anything north of ₹400 based on fundamentals.

### What the model is telling us
*   **The Disconnect:** The market is pricing this like a high-growth tech stock (30x EBITDA), but the cash flows look more like a steady industrial compounder. 
*   **Growth Assumptions:** I modeled ~12% revenue growth tapering down to 5%. To get anywhere near the current share price, you'd need to believe they can grow at 25%+ for the next decade *and* expand margins significantly. 
*   **WACC:** Used 11%. Even if I drop this to 9% (aggressive for a mid-cap in this rate environment), the value only bumps to ~₹350.

### The "Street" View vs. My Numbers
*   **My Fair Value (DCF):** ₹215
*   **Trading Comps:** Peers like Adani Ports and CONCOR trade at ~18-20x EBITDA. Aegis is commanding a huge premium (30x+).
*   **DDM:** Not a yield play. Dividends only support ~₹88 of value.

### Recommendation
**Avoid / Sell into strength.** 
Great company, clean balance sheet, but the valuation leaves zero margin of safety. The price seems to be driven by narrative (gas infra story) rather than current cash flow reality. Unless there's a massive capex announcement or acquisition I'm missing, the risk/reward is skewed to the downside.
